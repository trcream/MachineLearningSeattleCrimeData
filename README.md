For this assignment you will:

* Demonstrate your mastery of machine learning on a dataset of your choosing.
* You will then try to learn something from your data. What you learn is up to you but it should have some utility.
* You will need to use multiple learning methods and compare to each other.
* Then you will need to tune and validate your model.
* Finally, visualize somthing from your data (how/what is up to you).

## Data Requirements

The data you choose must:

* Be recently posted this year, although it can be data for last year that was just published this year.
* Must have at least 500 records.

Once you pick a data source and problem you will need to post on Piazza to:

1. Identify the data source
2. What you wish to learn from the data
3. How you want to visualize it.

The teaching team will provide feedback. The data sets are on a first-come-first-serve basis. You are encouraged to start early.

## Jupyter

You will complete the included Jupyter Notebook and provide nessessary and sufficient documentation so that the teaching team can have a full understanding of your project and run you code without errors. Be sure to also answer the reflection questions at the end of the notebook.

## Presentation

You will present your work to the class in 3-5 minute lecture with slides. Add your presentation slides to this repository in .pdf or .pptx format only.
