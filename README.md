Topics: Everything

For this assignment you will:

* Demonstrate your mastery of machine learning on a dataset of your choosing.
* You will then try to learn something from your data. What you learn is up to you but it should have some utility.
* You will need to use multiple learning methods and compare to each other.
* Then you will need to tune and validate your model.
* Finally, visualize somthing from your data (how/what is up to you).

The teaching team will provide feedback. The data sets are on a first-come-first-serve basis. You are encouraged to start early.

## Jupyter

You will complete the included Jupyter Notebook and provide nessessary and sufficient documentation so that the teaching team can have a full understanding of your project and run you code without errors. Be sure to also answer the reflection questions at the end of the notebook.

## Presentation

You will present your work to the class in 3-5 minute lecture with slides. Add your presentation slides to this repository in .pdf or .pptx format only.
